# The Seed:
consider living in smart home. most of home tasks is covered and automated.</br>
you don't have to manage foods in your fridge, but what about foods outside fridge?</br>
foods you put it in a jar on shelf? like granualr material : Tea, Pop corn, herbs and so on </br>
there is nothing made to detect the lack of them. so although you live in smart home </br>
but you surprised of empty jars!
